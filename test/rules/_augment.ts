// The runtime tests (and the bench fixture) exercise data-only / custom rules
// with ad-hoc keys. Now that `RouteRuleConfig` is a **closed** interface, those
// keys must be declared via module augmentation — the same mechanism real
// consumers (e.g. Nitro's `isr`/`prerender`/`static`) use. This file mirrors
// that adaptation for the test + bench fixtures so their configs keep
// type-checking; it declares no runtime values and is never imported/run.
//
// Runtime behavior is unchanged: unknown keys still flow through
// normalize/match/merge as data-only rules — augmentation only re-opens typing.
//
// The two interfaces carry the **same shape**: `RouteRuleConfig` (`h3/rules`)
// types what is authored, `RouteRules` (h3 core, the single shared one) what the
// merge resolves — and the merged value *is* the config value. Declaring
// `RouteRules` is therefore all it takes to type a custom rule on
// `event.context.routeRules`; there is no second, wrapper-shaped declaration.
//
// Each interface is augmented in the module that **declares** it. Augmenting
// through a re-export does merge, but only reliably so when nothing else in the
// program augments the declaring module — which is exactly what the sibling
// type tests do.
