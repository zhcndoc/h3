 * The request body is streamed to the target without buffering. Per the Fetch
 * standard, a request body can only be consumed once, so reading it beforehand
 * (e.g. via `readBody()`, `readFormData()`, or body-reading middleware) locks
 * the stream and proxying fails. If you need to inspect the body and still
 * proxy it, read from a clone and leave the original event untouched.
 *
 * Upstream 3xx responses are passed through to the client by default rather than
 * followed. Set `fetchOptions: { redirect: "follow" }` to follow them instead —

 * cannot be replayed once consumed.
 *
 * **Security:** Never pass unsanitized user input as the `target`. Callers are
 * responsible for validating and restricting the target URL (e.g. allowlisting
 * hosts, blocking internal paths, enforcing protocol). Consider using
 * `bodyLimit()` middleware to prevent large request bodies from consuming
 * excessive resources when proxying untrusted input.
 *
 * **Credential forwarding:** the incoming request's `Cookie` and `Authorization`
 * headers are forwarded to the `target` verbatim. This is the correct behavior
 * for a same-trust reverse proxy, but leaks the client's credentials to any
 * upstream you do not fully trust. When proxying to a not-fully-trusted upstream,
 * strip them with `filterHeaders: ["cookie", "authorization"]`. (This differs
 * from `fetchWithEvent`, which never forwards the event's headers to an external
 * URL.)
 *
 * @example
 * app.all("/proxy", async (event) => {
 *   const body = await event.req.clone().json(); // read from the clone
 *   // ...inspect body...
