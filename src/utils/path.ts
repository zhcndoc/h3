   * Also decode percent-encoded path separators (`%2f`, `%5c`) into real `/`
   * segment boundaries before resolving `.`/`..`.
   *
   * `event.url.pathname` never decodes `%2f` on its own, because doing so
   * would change how many segments a path has and therefore which route
   * matches — a correctness concern for dispatch, not just a security one
   * (e.g. `/files/:id` may rely on `%2F` to keep an id with a literal slash
   * as one opaque segment). So never use the result for routing/dispatch.
   *
   * Enable this for any out-of-band scope/security check whose result is
   * later handed to something that collapses `%2f` back to `/` on its own —
   * which is the common case, not an exotic one: an ordinary reverse proxy
   * (e.g. nginx with a trailing-slash `proxy_pass`) decodes `%2f`→`/` on every
   * request, so an encoded separator that dodges a narrower rule at match time
   * then escapes it downstream. If a scope check feeds a proxy or redirect
   * target, you almost certainly want this on.
   *
   * Decoding is pessimistic but bounded: it collapses a separator nested as
   * repeated whole `%25` prefixes (`%252f`, `%25252f`, ...) at any depth, so a
   * downstream that keeps `%25`-re-encoding and decoding cannot smuggle one
   * past. It does NOT catch a separator whose own hex digits are themselves
   * percent-encoded (`%25%32%66` → `%2f` → `/` after two decodes) — and that
   * form can appear even in an already-once-decoded pathname (from wire
   * `%2525%2532%2566`), so once-decoded input is not by itself sufficient.
   * Treat this as covering the common `%25`-nesting case, not as an absolute
   * guarantee against every multi-decode chain. Other escapes (e.g. `%20`) are
   * never decoded.
   *

 * Interior empty segments are preserved (`/a//b` stays `/a//b`, per WHATWG URL
 * normalization) — only the leading slash is guaranteed single, so a consumer
