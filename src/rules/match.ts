 * - **An empty `//` segment** survives h3's canonical form but rou3 won't match

 *   `merge_slashes`) could reach a path whose gate never ran — hence the second,
 *   slash-merged reading (mirroring `isPathInScope`'s two interpretations).
 * - **An escape h3 serves opaque** — one the URL serializer would re-add (`%20`,
 *   non-ASCII, `%22 %3C %3E %5E %60 %7B %7D`), a C0 control, or `%25` at any
 *   nesting depth (`%2540`). h3's pathname decodes only the *needless* escapes
 *   (`canonicalPathname`, so `/%40admin` already arrives as `/@admin`), while a
 *   rule pattern is written with the character itself (`/a b/**`). Without the
 *   {@link decodedPath} reading, `/a%20b/...` walks past that gate and a proxied
 *   backend — or any consumer that decodes — serves it as `/a b/...`.
 *   A consumer that decodes also *resolves*, so when the decoded path is not
 *   itself canonical it contributes its canonical readings rather than the
 *   intermediate spelling — which is also what catches a dot segment whose hex
 *   digits were themselves encoded (`%25%32%65` → `%2e` → `.`).
 *
 * Fast path: a pathname already canonical under the strictest reading is
 * canonical under every weaker one, and one with no `%` has nothing to decode,
 * so no reading can differ from the served path — an `includes("%")` and one
 * h3-owned scan (`isCanonicalPath` via `needsCanonicalPasses`, never a local
