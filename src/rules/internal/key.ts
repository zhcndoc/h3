 *
 * The matcher matches a `decodePreservingSeparators` reading of every request
 * path (see `decodedPath`), which is what makes a pattern written with the
 * character itself cover the encoded spelling. This is the other half: without
 * it an *encoded* pattern would silently cover only the encoded spelling —
 * under-protecting, since the raw spelling is the one clients normally send.
 *
 * Two passes, both idempotent (decoding only ever removes escapes, never
 * introduces one) — which the compiler's byte-identical codegen depends on:
 *
 * 1. {@link canonicalPathname}, the exact pass h3 applies to a route pattern
 *    (`H3.route`) and to every request path. This is what keeps a rule key and
 *    the equivalent route agreeing on one spelling: `/a/%3Aid` is the `:id`
 *    param route in both, and `/f/%2A%2A` the catch-all in both. Holding rou3
 *    syntax back here instead would leave the pattern matching only the encoded
 *    spelling — which no request can carry anymore, since the same pass decodes
 *    it on the way in, so the rule would silently never fire.
 * 2. A wider whole-run decode for the escapes canonicalization leaves alone but
 *    the matcher's decoded reading resolves: `%20`, non-ASCII (`%C3%A9`, decoded
 *    as a run so the multi-byte sequence survives), and the escapes the URL
 *    serializer re-adds. Only `%2F`, `%5C` and `%25` are still reachable as
 *    unsafe decodes at this point, and those stay encoded — a separator can
 *    never gain the pattern a segment boundary the router did not match on.
