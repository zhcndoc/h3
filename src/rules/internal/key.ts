 * way that route is spelled.
 *
 * Needless escapes decode (`/%40admin/**` → `/@admin/**`, as for every request
 * path), so an escaped rou3 metacharacter becomes one in both (`/a/%3Aid` is the
 * `:id` param route); raw text the URL serializer would encode is encoded
 * (`/café` → `/caf%C3%A9`, constraint text included — rou3 never encodes a
 * constraint itself); dot segments resolve. Every other escape stays exactly as
 * written: decoding `%7B` or `%3F` would turn a literal into rou3 group or
 * optional syntax, an escape inside a constraint is literal regex text, and
 * recasing one would make the key miss its own route's spelling. Other spellings
 * of a request (decoded, nested, hex-recased) are the matcher's alternate
 * readings (see `alternateReadings`).
 *
 * Idempotent, which the compiler's byte-identical codegen depends on: run to a
 * fixpoint because canonicalizing can fabricate a new escape (`%2%31` → `%21`)
 * that a second call would decode. It terminates: only the first round encodes,
 * and every later change shortens the path.
