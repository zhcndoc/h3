# Event Object

> Event object carries an incoming request and context.

Every time a new HTTP request comes, h3 internally creates an Event object and passes it though event handlers until sending the response.

An event is passed through all the lifecycle hooks and composable utils to use it as context.

**Example:**

```js
import { getQuery, readJSONBody } from "h3";

app.use(async (event) => {
  // Log event. `.toString()` stringifies to a simple string like `[GET] /<path>`
  console.log(`Request: ${event.toString()}`);

  // Parse query params
  const query = getQuery(event);

  // Try to read request body
  const body = await readJSONBody(event).catch(() => {});

  // Echo back request as response
  return {
    path: event.path,
    method: event.method,
    query,
    body,
  };
});
```

## Properties

The main properties of an event are:

### `event.method`

Access to the normalized (uppercase) request [method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

### `event.path`

Access to the request path. (**Example:** `/test?test=123`)

- `context` with some context information about the request.
- `headers` with a **normalized version** of the headers of the request.
- `handled` with a boolean that indicates if the request has terminated.

### `event.headers`

Access to the normalized request [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers).

> [!TIP]
> You can alternatively use `getRequestHeaders(event)` or `getRequestHeader(event, name)` for a simplified interface.

### `event.context`

The context is an object that contains arbitrary information about the request.
You can store your custom properties inside `event.context` to share across composable utils.
